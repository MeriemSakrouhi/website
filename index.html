I am a 5th year architecture student, so I have the need to show my online portfolio of my architecture projects. However, I also have a need to share other things that I have done as a product design, paintings, photography and videos that I have made. I would like my own website/ portfolio that shows the things I have done (to be hired) and/or create my web identity.
